# Project Overview: Banking Customer Churn Prediction

### ⚙️ Code: [Churn_Prediction_Model.ipynb](https://github.com/lekhakasinadhuni07/Churn-Prediction-Model/blob/main/Banking_Churn_Prediction_model.ipynb)


### 🎯 Goals:
- Predict whether a bank customer is likely to churn based on historical data.
- Analyze key factors influencing customer retention.
- Build an accurate machine learning model to classify customers as "churn" or "retain.


### 📖 Description:
This project focuses on customer churn prediction in the banking industry using machine learning algorithms. The dataset includes demographic, financial, and transaction-related features to identify patterns among customers likely to leave.

✔ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** (Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)

✔ **Exploratory Data Analysis** (Visualizing correlations and trends)

✔ **Feature Engineering** (Transforming data for better predictions)

✔ **Model Training & Evaluation** (Random Forest Classifier)

✔ **Performance Metrics** (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy Score, Classification Report)


### 🛠 Skills Demonstrated:
✅ **Machine Learning** (Supervised Learning, Classification)

✅ **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**

✅ **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

✅ **Model Evaluation** (Confusion Matrix, Precision-Recall, Accuracy)

✅ **SQL-like Data Handling** (Pandas, NumPy)

### 🖥 Technologies & Tools Used:
🔹 **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

🔹 **Machine Learning** (Random Forest Classifier)

🔹 **Feature Encoding** (Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding)

🔹 **Data Handling** (Pandas for CSV processing, handling missing values)

### 📊 Results & Key Insights:
- High accuracy achieved using Random Forest Classifier.
- Gender, Geography, and Credit Score were key factors affecting churn.
- Feature Engineering (like One-Hot Encoding) improved model performance.
- Balanced class distribution was considered to avoid bias in predictions.
- Insights help banks develop retention strategies based on high-risk customers.
