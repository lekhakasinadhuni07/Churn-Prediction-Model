# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview: Banking Customer Churn Prediction
## ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
- Predict whether a bank customer is likely to churn based on historical data.
- Analyze key factors influencing customer retention.
- Build an accurate machine learning model to classify customers as "churn" or "retain.

## ðŸ“– Description:
This project focuses on customer churn prediction in the banking industry using machine learning algorithms. The dataset includes demographic, financial, and transaction-related features to identify patterns among customers likely to leave.

âœ… **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**

âœ… **Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)**

âœ… **Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Precision-Recall, Accuracy)**

âœ… **SQL-like Data Handling (Pandas, NumPy)**

## ðŸ–¥ Technologies & Tools Used:
ðŸ”¹ **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**

ðŸ”¹ **Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)**

## ðŸ“Š Results & Key Insights:
- High accuracy achieved using Random Forest Classifier.
- Gender, Geography, and Credit Score were key factors affecting churn.
- Feature Engineering (like One-Hot Encoding) improved model performance.
- Balanced class distribution was considered to avoid bias in predictions.
- Insights help banks develop retention strategies based on high-risk customers.
